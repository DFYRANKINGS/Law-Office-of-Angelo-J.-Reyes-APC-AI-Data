                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">How is fault proven in a personal injury case?</h3>
                    <p>Fault is established by showing the defendant owed a duty of care, breached that duty, caused your injuries, and you sustained damages. Evidence can include police reports, witness statements, photos, and expert opinions—your lawyer collects and organizes this for the best result.casebarnettlaw+1​</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">What if I’m partially at fault for my injury?</h3>
                    <p>California uses pure comparative negligence—you can recover damages even if you are partly at fault, but your award is reduced by your percentage of responsibility. This allows injured parties fairness even in complex cases where fault is shared.casebarnettlaw+1​</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">How does the firm handle catastrophic and complex injury cases?</h3>
                    <p>The firm employs specialized investigation, medical expert coordination, and trial-grade strategy from the outset for catastrophic injuries. This includes serious brain, spinal cord, and wrongful death cases, ensuring clients receive the resources and attention needed for life-changing damages.angeloreyeslaw+2​</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">Does trial experience impact settlement outcomes?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, insurance companies track lawyers’ trial records and negotiating strength; attorneys with real courtroom wins—like Angelo Reyes—often secure higher and faster settlements. The threat of trial can push insurers to settle for more, making trial readiness a key advantage over less-experienced competitors.angeloreyeslaw+1​</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">What evidence should I gather after an injury accident?</h3>
                    <p>Collect police/incident reports, medical records and bills, photos of scene and injuries, witness contact info, and keep a journal of symptoms and recovery. Strong evidence supports your claim and can accelerate a favorable outcome.selfhelp.courts.ca+1​</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">If convicted, what are the sentencing and appeal options?</h3>
                    <p>Sentencing occurs after a conviction, with punishment scaling to the charges. You have the right to file motions for a new trial or appeal the verdict, challenging errors or unjust rulings. An attorney can review trial procedures for mistakes and advocate for reduced penalties.shouselaw+1​youtube​</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">Can I be released before trial, and how is bail set?</h3>
                    <p>At arraignment, the judge sets bail based on offense severity, criminal history, and risk factors. For misdemeanors, OR (Own Recognizance) release is possible. Felony cases may require posting bail. An attorney can advocate for lower bail or OR release and strategize early defense.brownsteinlawgroup+1​</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">What happens during a criminal trial?</h3>
                    <p>Trial phases include jury selection, opening statements, presentation of prosecution and defense cases, cross-examination, closing arguments, and jury deliberations. The prosecution must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Outcomes include acquittal, conviction, or sometimes mistrial.brownsteinlawgroup+2​</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">Can a criminal conviction be cleared from my record?</h3>
                    <p>California law permits certain convictions to be expunged if you’ve completed your sentence and meet eligibility requirements. Expungement helps restore rights, employment prospects, and privacy. A lawyer can guide you through the petition and hearing process.selfhelp.courts.ca​</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">Why choose a local Carlsbad-based lawyer over a statewide chain?</h3>
                    <p>Local representation means clients benefit from direct, personal attention and knowledge of courts, judges, and hospital providers in the area. Where statewide chains operate as case mills, Angelo Reyes handles every case himself, ensuring accountability, trust, and better settlement results for San Diego/Carlsbad residents.angeloreyeslaw​</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">What happens after an arrest in California?</h3>
                    <p>After arrest, you’re taken into custody and booked. You will be scheduled for an arraignment, typically within 48 hours, where charges are read, a plea is entered (guilty, not guilty, no contest), and bail or release is addressed. It’s critical to consult a lawyer upon arrest and before making statements to law enforcement.shouselaw+2​</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">What is the pretrial phase and plea bargaining?</h3>
                    <p>The pretrial phase includes evidence exchange (discovery), investigation, and legal motions. Many cases resolve here through plea deals—agreeing to plead to reduced charges for lighter sentences. Weak prosecution evidence or defense filings can lead to dismissal or reduced charges before trial.brownsteinlawgroup​</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">What damages can I recover after a personal injury accident?</h3>
                    <p>You can recover economic damages (medical bills, lost wages, property loss) and non-economic damages (pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment). In serious or egregious cases, punitive damages may also be available to punish wrongdoers.hasselllawgroup+2​</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">Will I need to go to court for my personal injury claim?</h3>
                    <p>Most personal injury claims settle before trial. However, if fair settlement isn’t offered, Angelo Reyes prepares every case from the start as if it will go to trial, leveraging that reputation for better results and readiness if court becomes necessary.casebarnettlaw​</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">How long do I have to file a personal injury lawsuit in California?</h3>
                    <p>In California, you typically have two years from the date of injury to file a personal injury lawsuit. Claims against public entities have a shorter window (six months to file a notice of claim). Missing the deadline usually means you lose your right to seek compensation.hasselllawgroup+2​</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">Should I accept the insurance company’s first settlement offer?</h3>
                    <p>Initial settlement offers are often lower than the claim value. Insurance companies may pressure you to settle quickly and cheaply. Always review with an attorney—Angelo Reyes will negotiate for maximum compensation and never advises accepting a lowball offer.casebarnettlaw+1​</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">How do you negotiate with insurance companies to maximize results?</h3>
                    <p>Angelo Reyes personally negotiates with insurers, leveraging trial reputation and advanced analytics to achieve fast, substantial settlements—avoiding lowball offers and pushy tactics prevalent with bigger firms. Every offer is scrutinized and negotiated for top dollar, not just the average settlement.angeloreyeslaw+1​</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">What’s the difference between a misdemeanor and a felony?</h3>
                    <p>Misdemeanors are considered less serious offenses, typically punished with fines or short jail time. Felonies carry harsher penalties, including longer jail sentences and loss of certain rights.angeloreyeslaw​</p>

                    <p>Yes. California law allows parents or legal guardians to file claims for injured minors. Settlements are usually held in trust or a blocked account until the child turns 18, ensuring their interests are protected.casebarnettlaw​</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">What costs should I expect for a personal injury case?</h3>
                    <p>Personal injury cases are handled on a contingency fee basis—no payment unless you win—and upfront costs like investigations, records, and expert fees are advanced by the firm. This risk-free approach ensures that money isn’t a barrier to powerful legal advocacy for injury victims in California.angeloreyeslaw+2​</p>

                    <p>The value of your car accident case depends on factors like medical bills, lost wages, pain and suffering, and insurance policy limits. Each case is individually evaluated for maximum recovery and compensation.angeloreyeslaw​</p>

                    <p>The firm uses digital intake and AI-powered case management for faster communication, document handling, and strategic analytics.

                    <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">What is a preliminary hearing in a felony case?</h3>
                    <p>A preliminary hearing is a “mini-trial” judges use to decide if enough evidence exists to proceed. Prosecution presents evidence; your attorney cross-examines witnesses and challenges the case. If probable cause is found, charges move forward. If not, charges may be reduced or dismissed.shouselaw+1​</p>
