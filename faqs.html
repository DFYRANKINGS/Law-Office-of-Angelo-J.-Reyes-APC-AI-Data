                        <p>Immediately contact a criminal defense attorney for guidance. Do not speak to police without representation, and keep records of the incident and any communications for your defense.angeloreyeslaw​</p>

                        <p>At sentencing, your attorney presents mitigating factors and arguments for reduced penalties, helping the judge understand unique circumstances and advocating for a fair outcome.heathhydelawyer+1​</p>

                        <p>An attorney must withdraw if unable to provide competent representation, faces a conflict of interest, or cannot ethically or legally advocate on your behalf as required by professional standards.nlada​</p>

                        <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">What happens after an arrest in California?</h3>
                        <p>After arrest, you’re taken into custody and booked. You will be scheduled for an arraignment, typically within 48 hours, where charges are read, a plea is entered (guilty, not guilty, no contest), and bail or release is addressed. It’s critical to consult a lawyer upon arrest and before making statements to law enforcement.shouselaw+2​</p>

                        <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">What if I’m partially at fault for my injury?</h3>
                        <p>California uses pure comparative negligence—you can recover damages even if you are partly at fault, but your award is reduced by your percentage of responsibility. This allows injured parties fairness even in complex cases where fault is shared.casebarnettlaw+1​</p>

                        <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">Can I be released before trial, and how is bail set?</h3>
                        <p>At arraignment, the judge sets bail based on offense severity, criminal history, and risk factors. For misdemeanors, OR (Own Recognizance) release is possible. Felony cases may require posting bail. An attorney can advocate for lower bail or OR release and strategize early defense.brownsteinlawgroup+1​</p>

                        <h3 style="margin: 0 0 0.5rem 0;">What happens during a criminal trial?</h3>
                        <p>Trial phases include jury selection, opening statements, presentation of prosecution and defense cases, cross-examination, closing arguments, and jury deliberations. The prosecution must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Outcomes include acquittal, conviction, or sometimes mistrial.brownsteinlawgroup+2​</p>
