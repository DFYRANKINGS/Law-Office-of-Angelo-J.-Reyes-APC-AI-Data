  "question": "What happens after an arrest in California?",
  "answer": "After arrest, you’re taken into custody and booked. You will be scheduled for an arraignment, typically within 48 hours, where charges are read, a plea is entered (guilty, not guilty, no contest), and bail or release is addressed. It’s critical to consult a lawyer upon arrest and before making statements to law enforcement.shouselaw+2​"
