  "question": "How long do I have to file a personal injury lawsuit in California?",
  "answer": "In California, you typically have two years from the date of injury to file a personal injury lawsuit. Claims against public entities have a shorter window (six months to file a notice of claim). Missing the deadline usually means you lose your right to seek compensation.hasselllawgroup+2â€‹"
