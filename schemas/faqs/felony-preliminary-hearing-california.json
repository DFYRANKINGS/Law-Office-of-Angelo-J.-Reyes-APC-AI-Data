  "question": "What is a preliminary hearing in a felony case?",
  "answer": "A preliminary hearing is a “mini-trial” judges use to decide if enough evidence exists to proceed. Prosecution presents evidence; your attorney cross-examines witnesses and challenges the case. If probable cause is found, charges move forward. If not, charges may be reduced or dismissed.shouselaw+1​"
