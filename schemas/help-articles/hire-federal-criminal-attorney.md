You should hire a federal criminal defense attorney as soon as you suspect you are under investigation or immediately after being contacted by federal agents. Early intervention can prevent charges or protect your rights by ensuring proper legal strategy from the outset. Federal cases are handled in harsher courts with complex procedures, so timely legal advice is critical for a successful defense.heathhydelawyer
