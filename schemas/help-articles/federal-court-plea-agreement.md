A plea agreement in federal court is a negotiated deal where you plead guilty to a lesser charge or receive a lighter sentence. This is often considered when the evidence against you is strong. Your attorney will advise if accepting a plea deal is in your best interest or if you should proceed to trial, weighing the risks and benefits carefully.heathhydelawyer
