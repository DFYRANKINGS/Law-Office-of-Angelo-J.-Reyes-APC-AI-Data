During a felony preliminary hearing, the judge evaluates the prosecutionâ€™s evidence to decide if probable cause exists to proceed to trial. Defense counsel has the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses and challenge the evidence's validity. This hearing is a critical step in determining whether the case advances to the trial phase.sandiegocriminalattorneys+1
