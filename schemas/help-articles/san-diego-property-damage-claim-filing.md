To file a property damage claim in San Diego, present it to either: (1) the at-fault driver’s insurer, (2) your own insurance if you have collision coverage, or (3) the responsible individual. Documentation like repair estimates, photos, and police reports help speed claims. You can have your car repaired or compensated for its value, including total loss compensation when repair costs exceed car value. Expert legal advice ensures you aren’t stuck with repair bills for accidents you didn’t cause.seriousaccidents+1
