Diminished value refers to the reduction in your vehicleâ€™s market value after an accident, even if fully repaired. You may claim compensation for diminished value by proving your car's resale worth has declined due to its accident history. Expert appraisals are usually required to validate diminished value claims.missionlegalcenter
