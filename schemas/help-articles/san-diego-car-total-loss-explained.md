When repair estimates exceed your vehicleâ€™s market value, the insurance company may declare it a total loss. In this case, you are entitled to receive the fair market value of the vehicle prior to the accident, which should cover buying a replacement. You also have the option to decline repairs and accept total loss payment. Understanding total loss ensures you get fair compensation for your damaged vehicle.seriousaccidents+1
