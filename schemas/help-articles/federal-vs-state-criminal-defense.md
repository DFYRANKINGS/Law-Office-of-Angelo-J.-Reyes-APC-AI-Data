This article explains how federal versus state criminal defense differs in jurisdiction, penalties, procedures, and prosecuting authorities. Federal cases are prosecuted in U.S. District Courts and typically involve nationwide laws or interstate crimes. State cases are charged in local Superior or trial courts under state law, usually for crimes occurring within a single state. Attorneys must strategize according to each systemâ€™s rules and agencies.
